### [Slitherskin Drinkery](../slitherskin-drinkery)

In the forgotten town of **Slitherskin Hollow**, an ancient secret lurks just beneath the surface. The town’s fame rests solely on the reputation of its brewery, the **Slitherskin Drinkery**, where the thick and venom-laced **Slitherskin** brew is served to daring patrons. However, unknown to most, this brew’s unique flavor comes from a sinister source—a monstrous snake that resides beneath the drinkery, its shed skin used to make the infamous snake-skin mugs, and its venom harvested for the brew.
